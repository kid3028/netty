/**
 * channel 提供了对socket的绑定、连接、读写的能力
 *
 * channel提供的能力：
 *   当前channel的状态：打开或者连接
 *   ChannelConfig封装了channel的配置参数
 *   对io操作的支持（绑定、连接、读写等）
 *   channelPipeline处理所有的io事件/所有本channel的请求
 *
 * A nexus to a network socket or a component which is capable of I/O
 * operations such as read, write, connect, and bind.
 * <p>
 * A channel provides a user:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the current state of the channel (e.g. is it open? is it connected?),</li>
 * <li>the {@linkplain ChannelConfig configuration parameters} of the channel (e.g. receive buffer size),</li>
 * <li>the I/O operations that the channel supports (e.g. read, write, connect, and bind), and</li>
 * <li>the {@link ChannelPipeline} which handles all I/O events and requests
 *     associated with the channel.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * 所有的io操作是异步的，所有的io调用将会立即返回，不保证io操作在调用结束时已经完成。
 * 操作将会返回一个ChannelFuture，当io请求处理完成后通知用户
 * <h3>All I/O operations are asynchronous.</h3>
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which will notify you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or canceled.
 *
 * Channel是有父子关系的。
 * Channel#parent()返回创建当前channel时依赖的channel。
 * 例如SocketChannel由ServerSocketChannel接收连接创建，故parent()将会返回ServerSocketChannel
 *
 * <h3>Channels are hierarchical</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} can have a {@linkplain #parent() parent} depending on
 * how it was created.  For instance, a {@link SocketChannel}, that was accepted
 * by {@link ServerSocketChannel}, will return the {@link ServerSocketChannel}
 * as its parent on {@link #parent()}.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the hierarchical structure depends on the transport
 * implementation where the {@link Channel} belongs to.  For example, you could
 * write a new {@link Channel} implementation that creates the sub-channels that
 * share one socket connection, as <a href="http://beepcore.org/">BEEP</a> and
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> do.
 *
 * <h3>Downcast to access transport-specific operations</h3>
 * <p>
 * Some transports exposes additional operations that is specific to the
 * transport.  Down-cast the {@link Channel} to sub-type to invoke such
 * operations.  For example, with the old I/O datagram transport, multicast
 * join / leave operations are provided by {@link DatagramChannel}.
 *
 * 释放资源
 * 当channel不再使用时，调用close()释放所有资源
 * <h3>Release resources</h3>
 * <p>
 * It is important to call {@link #close()} or {@link #close(ChannelPromise)} to release all
 * resources once you are done with the {@link Channel}. This ensures all resources are
 * released in a proper way, i.e. filehandles.
